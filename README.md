# ExpensesTracker
This project aims to empower users in efficiently managing their expenses. It boasts features that enable users to effortlessly visualize their highest, lowest, average, and overall expenses, along with insights into the categories consuming the most and least funds. With both user and admin access levels, the application offers versatile functionality.

User access facilitates the core functionalities of introducing, visualizing, and filtering expenses within the main application interface. On the other hand, admin access elevates the platform by enabling the creation of additional users and admins, while also granting the ability to visualize all user data in any desired filtered format.

In essence, the primary objective of this project is to equip users with comprehensive insights into their spending patterns, empowering them to make informed financial decisions and maintain meticulous expense records.
